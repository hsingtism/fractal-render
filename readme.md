# Fractal renderer

A C-based fractal renderer

## Usage

This is a general fractal renderer capable of rendering any fractal generated by iterating a value through a holomorphic function (complex valued and mostly differentiable). The fractals that can be rendered includes (but is not limited to)
- The Mandelbrot set and all its associated "Julian" sets
- The Burning Ship fractal
- Newton fractals of any polynomial, trig, hyperbolic trig, exp/log functions
- Fractals defined by most elementary functions
- Parameter space of any above-mentioned fractals

With some programming, it is possible to render very high resolution prints and/or videos to panning or zooming into a fractal

## Compiling

Most c compilers should work. I developed it with gcc, the following command is used:
`gcc fractal.c render.c settings.c auxiliaryFunctions.c -O3`

__MAKE SURE TO COMPILE WITH TAIL-CALL RECURSION OPTIMIZATION ENABLED__ for larger iteration sizes

## Setting parameters

working in progress `settings.c`
intended for large render jobs so seprate program

## Output

By default, images are outputted in an uncompressed bitmap. Make appropriate modifications to `render.c` if you want to link anything to compress the images.
